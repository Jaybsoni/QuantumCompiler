# QuantumCompiler
***Note for QOSF mentorship:*** Please refer to the qosf-submission branch of the project as that is the state of the project at the time of the deadline. Since then I have fixed the implementation of the qbit router function for the 5qbit ring topology. You are also welcome to explore this master branch of the project to see the final end product.
